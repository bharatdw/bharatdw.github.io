			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				The expectation from the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication system is that it will be able to 
				handle about 1000 times more mobile data than todayâ€™s cellular systems. It will also become the backbone 
				of the Internet of things (IoT) communication, linking up fixed and mobile devices, Sensor boards etc. 
				The 5G cellular architecture follows a hierarchical concept, where channel reallocation efficiency is 
				improved through the concepts of small cell networks. The small cell networks, which are known as 
				macro-cellular network and pico-cellular networks based on the cell sizes, are efficient for low-range 
				communication, such as IoT communication. To improve the energy efficiency and network manageability with 
				low cost solutions, the 5G architecture also brings the concept of cloud based radio access networks (CRAN) 
				where the baseband processor is physically segregated from radio frequency (RF) processor. To reduce the 
				operational costs as well as to improve energy efficiency, the baseband processor is virtualized and is 
				hosted over a cloud based framework so that the same cloud server can be reused for multiple baseband 
				processing units (BBU), called the BBU pool over the cloud. This significantly reduces the cost for the 
				RF transceivers that can be utilized to implement multiple macro base
				stations (called, macro eNodeB or macro-eNB) or pico base stations (called pico-eNB). Such macro-eNB and 
				pico-eNB can be effectively utilized for IoT communication in multiple
				applications, like industrial control and automation, vehicular IoT or smart city context.</p>
				
				<p>However from the initial implementation of the CRAN architecture, we realized that although such kind of 
				architecture can provide an energy efficient, low operational cost, high availability and easy manageable 
				solution for IoT communication over small cell networks, there are also several challenges that need to be 
				addressed. First, many of the times IoT communications are delay and quality of service (QoS) sensitive, like 
				in the case of industrial automation. However, the delay between the RF transceivers and BBU pool hosted on a 
				remote cloud significantly affect the performance of the communication, in terms of throughput, delay, QoS and 
				fairness. Therefore, the delay between the RF transceivers and cloud needs to be reduced for IoT communication 
				over small cell. Second, the IoT communication infrastructure is itself heterogeneous by nature, where multiple 
				frequency bands from various technologies (like 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz Wi-Fi communication or Bluetooth low energy 
				communication) can be utilized at the client devices, along with the cellular communication. Therefore, the 
				support at the base station needs to be heterogeneous and interoperable, so that the IoT clients can seamlessly 
				communicate over the backbone.
			</p><p>To address the above two challenges, in this project, we plan to develop a new 
				architectural framework for ubiquitous IoT communication, that leverage the advantages provided by CRAN and 
				small cell based cellular communication, and brings the delay sensitivity, QoS and network
				heterogeneity solutions under the hood. We plan to develop a fog based hybrid radio access network framework, 
				called Distributed Radio Network Architecture (DRoNA), which will apply the BBU pool virtualization concept at 
				the edge, which is near to the small cell networks for IoT communication. Further, we plan to extend the near-the-edge 
				BBU pool virtualization for multiple technology support via Cooperative Radio Resource Management (CRRM) and Collaborative 
				Radio Signal Processing along with fronthaul compression techniques. We plan to implement a testbed for DRoNA, which 
				can be utilized for prototyping ubiquitous IoT communications that has applications over diverse domains of cyber physical 
				system, like industrial automation and control, vehicular safety and control management and smart city management.
