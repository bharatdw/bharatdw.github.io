		<h2>Use Cases</h2>
		<ul class="blog">
			<li>
				<h3>1: Industrial IoT</h3>

				<p>
					Industrial IoT shows a complex cyber physical system architecture, where time is criticality important for plant automation and control. As DRoNA helps in providing QoS for the time-critical data with low management cost, it can be very helpful for setting up the backbone of an industrial IoT platform.

				<p>
					The smart traffic management system, as shown in above figure, displays a rich setup of connectivity and interactions, which requires real time data traffic and fast processing. Connected vehicles of all types communicating at busy intersection to share crowd- sourced information about the traffic, shortest path with better quality air and etc. This kind of versatility in the underlying communication platform can be effectively managed by DRoNA architecture, where a small cell network can serve a group of vehicles at a part of the roads. The small cell networks interconnect themselves via the macro-cellular network so that seamless information exchange is possible with minimum communication and processing delay.

				<h3>3: Cyber Physical Applications for Smart Healthcare and Smart City</h3>

				<p>
					IoT is a network that connects physical objects with identified address. It is a vast network of devices connected to the Internet including smart phones that generates a huge amount of data. IoT also organize the incorporation of computer and data centric physical and engineered systems. Making this architecture distributed will be helpful to reduce the latency and presenting real time data. In a smart-city environment, as shown in above figure, it is always necessary to connect the IoT infrastructure from various end applications with the Internet backbone, so that a common communication platform can be established and information exchange between various modules become possible. DRoNA can be significantly helpful in this context that provides a low cost and easy manageable solution for IoT communication over a smart city.
